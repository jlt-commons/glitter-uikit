  "The 7GUIs 'Temperature Converter' task
  (https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/tasks/#temp) over AppKit — two linked
  numeric fields (Celsius, Fahrenheit); editing one immediately updates the
  other. Per the spec: widgets 'indirectly linked to each other... in an
  equational way... must have their values updated eagerly... The exception
  being the widget that caused the change.'

  Ported from glitter's own examples/glitter/temperature.clj. The domain logic
  (fahrenheit->celsius, celsius->fahrenheit, set-temperature, format-number,
  parse-number) is carried across unchanged — it is pure, host-level Clojure
  with no toolkit in it, which is the whole point of glitter's renderer split.
  Only three things differ, all forced by the renderer:

  1. :width-chars is NOT a width here. It routes to setPreferredMaxLayoutWidth:
     (ffi.clj), a text-WRAPPING hint — measured: an :entry carrying
     :width-chars 12 still stretched to fill its row and squeezed its sibling
     :entry to zero width. glitter's :width-request DOES work, but only because
     this arc added it: it installs a real autolayout width constraint
     (ffi.clj set-width!). Use :width-request for a field that must be a given
     size; :width-chars only affects wrapping.
  2. app/run takes no :app-id — that is a GApplication identifier with no
     AppKit counterpart.
  3. The requires point at glitter-uikit.app / glitter-uikit.appkit. glitter.core
     and nexus.registry (the standalone nexus-jolt package) are shared verbatim.

  Why this task is a good fit for THIS renderer specifically: it writes back to
  the very field being typed in, on every keystroke. That is the exact case
  entry-spec's only-when-different guard exists for — unconditionally re-setting
  an NSTextField's stringValue mid-typing resets the insertion point. The guard
  is present here (widget.clj's entry-spec) but was MISSING from the
  glimmer-uikit original this port descends from; a verbatim port would have
  silently lost it, and this demo is where that loss would be felt first.

  Run: jolt -M:temperature or bb temperature. Needs a display; close the
  window to exit."

  Returns an EXPLICIT no-op ([], no effects, no swap!, no re-render) when
  neither field parsed. Upstream replicant-7uis' bare
  `(or celsius (fahrenheit->celsius fahrenheit))` shape would call
  fahrenheit->celsius on nil and throw — harmlessly caught by nexus, but
  relying on exception handling as the invalid-input strategy is the
  silent-swallow risk glitter's own nexus review flagged. On a no-op the
  just-typed invalid text stays in the field's live buffer untouched and the
  other field keeps its last valid value."

  overflows like \"1e400\" (-> ##Inf) without throwing, so try/catch alone does
  not reject them.

  The finiteness check deliberately avoids Double/isFinite: glitter verified
  live that it does not resolve under Jolt (Chez-Scheme host, not the JVM) —
  `No matching field or method: Double/isFinite`. The two portable checks used
  instead work on any host: (= parsed parsed) excludes NaN, since IEEE-754 NaN
  is never equal to itself, and ##Inf / ##-Inf are reader literals Jolt
  supports directly."
