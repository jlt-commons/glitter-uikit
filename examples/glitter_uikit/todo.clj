(ns glitter-uikit.todo
  "A task board demo — the AppKit sibling of glitter's examples/glitter/todo.clj,
  and a port of glimmer-uikit's examples/glimmer_uikit/todo.clj. Exercises
  derived counts computed inline from one state atom (no reaction — glitter has
  no reactive-derivation primitive; the whole view is re-run on every change),
  an entry (:change / :activate, with a placeholder), checkbutton toggles, and
  list rendering inside a frame.

  Contrast with glimmer-uikit's original: there, :done toggling and the draft
  entry are component-local ratoms mutated by closures captured per-row at
  render time. Here ALL state lives in one top-level atom, the view is a pure
  function of it, and every handler is DATA — an action tuple carrying whatever
  the closure used to close over (the row index, the new entry text) —
  dispatched through nexus (the standalone nexus-jolt package).

  This file mirrors glitter's own todo.clj's view shape and state model —
  same tags (both already use :vbox/:hbox rather than bare :box, so this
  file doesn't hit the box-orientation divergence documented in NOTICE.md's
  Known gaps), same actions, same nexus dispatch. It is NOT a byte-for-byte
  port apart from requires, though: the docstrings, inline comments, and
  prop-map formatting differ throughout (a ~150-line diff) — only the
  renderer-facing shape (view, state, actions) is what the seam guarantees
  stays unchanged.

  Run: jolt -M:todo. Needs a GUI session; close the window to exit."
