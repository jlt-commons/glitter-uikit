  "The 7GUIs 'CRUD' task (https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/tasks/#crud) over
  AppKit — a prefix filter, a selectable list of names, Name/Surname fields, and
  Create/Update/Delete. The spec's stated challenge is 'separation of domain and
  presentation logic', which here is `get-people`: one pure function, filtering
  and sorting, called by the view and by nothing else.

  glitter's own crud.clj renders the list with :list-box (GtkListBox). This
  renderer has no such tag, and the obvious conclusion — that CRUD needs
  NSTableView first — turned out to be wrong. A list box is functionally a
  SCROLLABLE COLUMN OF SELECTABLE ROWS, and that is buildable from tags this
  renderer already has: a :scrolled wrapping a :vbox of one :button per person.
  Selecting is just a click handler carrying the row's id as data.

  What that costs, stated plainly rather than glossed:

  - Rows look like buttons, because they are. A real NSTableView would give
    proper selection highlighting, keyboard navigation and alternating row
    colours for free. The selected row is marked with a caret in its label
    instead — visible, but not the platform's own selection affordance.
  - There is no keyboard navigation of the list at all.

  Both are presentation, not behaviour: every rule the 7GUIs spec states is
  satisfied. When :list-box / NSTableView does land, this view swaps its list
  section and nothing else changes — which is itself the point the renderer
  split keeps making.

  Uses counter.clj's plain state-atom dispatch rather than nexus. The
  three actions all need to read current state before deciding what to do, which
  is exactly what glitter needed nexus's action-EXPANSION layer for; a plain
  dispatch fn reads @state directly and needs no such layer.

  Run: jolt -M:crud or bb crud. Needs a display; close the window to exit."
