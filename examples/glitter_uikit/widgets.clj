  "Every widget tag this renderer registers, in one window.

  `counter.clj` and `todo.clj` between them exercise most of the registry, but
  two registered tags — :separator and :scrolled — had no runnable
  demonstration anywhere in the repo before this file. That is what this demo
  is for: it is the visual index of the widget layer, so a reader can see what
  `widget.clj`'s nine specs actually look like without reading the specs.

  Same model as counter.clj, not todo.clj: one top-level state atom, a pure
  state -> hiccup view, handlers as DATA dispatched through one global fn.
  todo.clj's nexus machinery is deliberately absent — the subject here
  is the widgets, and nexus would be a second thing to learn at the same time.

  Two gotchas this file has to respect, both documented in CONTRIBUTING.md:

  - :vbox / :hbox are named explicitly and never a bare :box. A bare [:box …]
    is VERTICAL under glitter.gtk but HORIZONTAL here (NSStackView's own
    default), so a literal port of a glitter view renders rotated 90°.
  - :frame and :scrolled are SINGLE-CHILD containers (:container :frame and
    :scrolled in widget.clj), so each wraps exactly one :vbox rather than
    taking a list of children directly."
