# The examples

`examples/glitter_uikit/` holds **sixteen runnable namespaces**, and every one
has a `deps.edn` alias and a `bb` task. They come in two kinds:

- **Eight interactive demos** you open and click — the galleries below.
- **Eight live-AppKit smokes**, each a small, complete glitter program that
  mounts a real window, asserts against real AppKit state, and exits non-zero
  on failure.

Run any of them with `bb <name>`, or `jolt -M:<name>` without babashka.
`bb info` prints the whole list grouped, and `bb smokes` runs all eight smokes
in sequence, stopping at the first failure.

All fourteen need a GUI session — no GTK4 required anymore, see
[Limitations](limitations.md) for the fix.

## Interactive demos

| preview | `bb` name | Task | What it demonstrates |
|---|---|---|---|
| [<img src="../demos/counter.gif" width="150">](../demos/counter.gif) | `counter` | [Counter](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/tasks/#counter) | The canonical demo. One state atom, a pure `state -> hiccup` view, handlers as data. The whole model in a window you can click through in ten seconds. |
| [<img src="../demos/temperature.gif" width="150">](../demos/temperature.gif) | `temperature` | [Temperature Converter](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/tasks/#temp) | Two linked numeric fields, each edit updating the other. Its domain half is glitter's, carried across unchanged — the pure part of a glitter app is renderer-agnostic, which is the point of the split. |
| [<img src="../demos/flights.gif" width="150">](../demos/flights.gif) | `flights` | [Flight Booker](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/tasks/#flight-booker) | Constraints *between* widgets and *within* one: a `:drop-down` choosing one-way/return, two strictly-validated date fields, and a Book button gated on both. |
| [<img src="../demos/timer.gif" width="150">](../demos/timer.gif) | `timer` | [Timer](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/tasks/#timer) | The only demo whose state advances **on its own** — a repeating `NSTimer` drives a `:progress-bar`, and moving the `:scale` changes the duration immediately rather than at the next tick. |
| [<img src="../demos/crud.gif" width="150">](../demos/crud.gif) | `crud` | [CRUD](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/tasks/#crud) | A prefix filter, a selectable list, and Create/Update/Delete gated on selection. The spec's "separation of domain and presentation logic" is `get-people` — one pure filter-and-sort fn. The list is built from `:scrolled` + `:button` rows rather than a table widget; see below. |
| [<img src="../demos/circles.png" width="150">](../demos/circles.png) | `circles` | [Circle Drawer](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/tasks/#circle-drawer) | Click to place a circle, click one to select it, adjust its diameter live, undo and redo. Circles are `CALayer`s, not views — a layer takes no part in hit-testing, so a click reaches the canvas even under a circle and hit-testing stays a pure function over the model. |
| [<img src="../demos/todo.gif" width="150">](../demos/todo.gif) | `todo` | — | A task board on `glitter.nexus`: derived counts computed inline on every re-render (glitter has no reactive-derivation primitive), an entry with `:change`/`:activate`, checkbutton toggles, list rendering in a frame. |

**7GUIs tasks 1 through 5 ship.** Task 5 arrived without `NSTableView`: a list
box is functionally a scrollable column of selectable rows, so `crud` builds one
from `:scrolled` + a `:button` per person, with the selected row marked by a
caret in its label. Every rule the spec states is satisfied; what is missing is
presentation — real selection highlighting, keyboard navigation, alternating row
colours — which a table widget would give for free. When `:list-box` lands, that
view swaps its list section and nothing else.

**Task 6 needed two things this renderer did not have**, and both are now in
it. Mouse coordinates: `+[NSEvent mouseLocation]` returns a `CGPoint`, a struct,
which no scalar message-send can carry — Jolt's FFI does support aggregate
returns, so `ffi.clj` gained struct-by-value sends and a screen→window→view
conversion. And free positioning: `NSStackView` places children in order, so the
`:canvas` tag is an `NSButton` (it must receive clicks) whose **layer** holds the
circles.

**Cells** (task 7) remains out of reach: a 100×26 spreadsheet with a formula
language, change propagation and cycle detection. 2,600 live cells is where
`NSTableView` stops being avoidable.

glitter itself ships tasks 1-5 and no further, so `circles` had no reference to
port — its model and its rendering are both original here.

## The widget gallery

| preview | gallery |
|---|---|
| [<img src="../demos/widgets.gif" width="170">](../demos/widgets.gif) | **`bb widgets`** — every tag the renderer registers, in one window. One state key, `:level`, is read by **three widgets at once**: a `:scale` drives it while a `:progress-bar` and a `:level-bar` display it, so dragging the slider shows a single key re-rendering everything that reads it. It is also the only example that exercises `:separator` and `:scrolled`. |

## Why the demos are worth reading, not just running

`counter.clj` says it directly in its own docstring: in glimmer-uikit (the
Reagent-style sibling this project was ported from), local state lives in a
component-scoped ratom and a click closure calls `swap!` itself. Here all state
is in one top-level atom, the view is a pure function of it, and click handlers
are *data* dispatched through one global fn, never closures.

`todo.clj` makes the same contrast at larger scale, and adds the derived-counts
point: there is no memoized selector, no reaction, no cache — the three numbers
above the task list are just arithmetic over `:tasks` re-run on every render,
because re-running the whole view is the model.

The three 7GUIs ports make a different point. Their domain halves —
`set-temperature`, `parse-date` / `get-form-state`, `get-view-state` — are
carried over from glitter **unchanged**, because they are pure Clojure with no
toolkit in them. Only the view and the `-main` differ. That is the renderer
split doing exactly what it exists to do.

## Findings worth knowing, from porting the 7GUIs demos

### `:width-chars` is not a width

Nothing in this renderer could give a control a width until `flights.clj` needed
one. `:width-chars` looks like the answer and is not — it routes to
`setPreferredMaxLayoutWidth:`, a text-*wrapping* hint that leaves a control free
to be compressed to nothing. The measured consequences were not subtle: an
`:entry` beside a label was squeezed to **zero width** and vanished, and where
it survived, a ten-character date rendered as `26.08.20`.

Four plausible routes were each tried against a live window and each did
nothing: `:vexpand false` on the container, `:hexpand true` on the field,
`:hexpand true` on the row, and `:halign :fill`. What works is `:width-request`,
which installs a real `NSLayoutConstraint`. The full table is in
[Limitations](limitations.md#sizing-width-chars-is-not-a-width-width-request-is).

### Lenient date parsing

`flights.clj` does not call `t/parse-date` directly. glitter verified that it is
**lenient** under this Jolt port: `"27.03.2014x"` parses to 2014-03-27 ignoring
the trailing garbage, `"not-a-date"` parses to `-0001-11-30`, and `"31.02.2014"`
— not a real date — rolls over to 2014-03-03. The round-trip wrapper (parse,
reformat with the *same* formatter, reject unless it matches the trimmed input
exactly) is what actually makes the spec's "coloured red when ill-formatted"
rule work. All four traps are re-verified here.

## Live-AppKit smokes

These are examples in exactly the sense the demos are — each mounts a window and
drives a real glitter view. What makes them smokes is that they then *assert*,
against the live AppKit tree rather than against the renderer's own bookkeeping,
which would agree with itself and pass even if no AppKit call ever landed.

`bb smokes` runs all eight in sequence and stops at the first failure. The full
argument for each — the exact assertions, and why each is shaped to fail loudly
instead of passing vacuously — is in
[Testing and tasks](testing-and-tasks.md#live-appkit-smokes). The tables below
are the index; that page is the argument.

## Smokes: reconciler behaviour

| `bb` name | Pins |
|---|---|
| `smoke` | A view function renders into a real `NSWindow`, and a state-atom write re-renders it. Start here. |
| `keyed-smoke` | A keyed reorder lands in the right live order **and reuses the same view pointers** rather than recreating them. Also pins the no-suppression property this renderer is built on. |
| `replace-child-smoke` | A replaced child stays at its **exact index**, not appended at the end — the `glimmer-uikit` original's bug. |
| `insert-before-smoke` | A new child lands mid-list; an existing child's keyed reorder **moves** rather than duplicates; a *forward* move lands at the sibling's un-incremented index — this port's own final-review fix. |

## Smokes: events and value delivery

| `bb` name | Pins |
|---|---|
| `reactivity-smoke` | A programmatic state write re-renders in place, **and** a real `-[NSControl performClick:]` dispatches through the target/action path the renderer actually wired — not a direct handler call, which would prove nothing about the wiring. |
| `handler-cleanup-smoke` | Unmounting a subtree drops every handler registration it held, **grandchildren included**. AppKit reuses freed addresses, so a leaked registration can be inherited by a newly allocated view at the same address. |

## Smokes: threading

| `bb` name | Pins |
|---|---|
| `main-thread-smoke` | A state change made from a **non-main thread** still renders on the AppKit main thread — the property the `CFRunLoopSource` scheduler exists for. |
| `repl-live-smoke` | The same marshalling, shaped like a live nREPL session: a worker thread mutates state while the app runs. An unmarshalled render touching AppKit off-main aborts the process outright, so surviving is itself part of the assertion. |

## How the recordings are made

Every preview above is a real recording of the demo being driven. They are
produced by `scripts/record_gifs.sh`, which drives each demo through `cgevent`'s
**accessibility API**: `:tap-by-role` sends `AXPress` to a real control, and once
a field is focused that way a synthetic `:type` lands in it. That is a different
mechanism from glitter's, which steers GTK with a raw Tab/Space/type timeline —
screen-grab's own README notes that a synthetic *click* "cannot actuate
in-window controls in any app", which is why the accessibility route is the one
that works here.

The flows live in `scripts/flows/*.edn`, one per demo, and are worth reading
before writing another. `:role`/`:text`/`:id` are the **only** selector shorthand
keys cgevent honours, so `{:role "AXButton" :title "Add"}` matches *any* button
and passes vacuously. An ambiguous match is an error, which is why
`flights.edn` taps only uniquely-named controls — both its date fields hold
today's date at startup.

### Recording one needs a click first

`scripts/record_gifs.sh` is **not** unattended. From a cold launch the app
exposes only a recursive `AXApplication` with no `AXWindow` child, so a flow
finds nothing to press; the subtree populates once a person clicks the window.
Activating through System Events, clicking the title bar synthetically, and
polling for four minutes all failed to wake it. The script waits — printing the
window's on-screen position — until you click, then records by itself.

`timer` is the exception that needs no click, because its flow contains no taps:
the demo advances on its own.

Whether an AppKit app launched bare by Jolt — no `.app` bundle, no bundle
identifier — *should* expose its window to accessibility before it is focused is
an open question, and the likeliest place a fix would come from.

The stills under `docs/demos/*.png` are kept alongside the GIFs and regenerate
unattended via `screen-grab shot --manifest scripts/demo_manifest.edn`, needing
no clicking at all. That is the CI-safe path if these ever have to be rebuilt
without a person present.

One further caveat if you touch `counter`: its committed screenshot shows
`Count: 5` because a person clicked the button five times. That frame cannot be
regenerated by the tool. The ledger hashes each item's `:src`, so an unchanged
`counter.clj` reports `up to date` and the frame is safe — but editing
`counter.clj`, or passing `--force`, recaptures it as an initial-state
`Count: 0`. Re-steer it by hand rather than committing that.

## Adding an example

Two touchpoints, and skipping either leaves the example invisible to something:

1. **The namespace** under `examples/glitter_uikit/`, plus a `deps.edn` alias so
   `jolt -M:<name>` works without babashka.
2. **A `bb.edn` task**, so `bb <name>` works and it shows up in `bb info`.

Then add its row here — to the demo gallery, or to the smoke index above. A new
smoke also belongs in `bb smokes` and in
[Testing and tasks](testing-and-tasks.md#live-appkit-smokes), which is where its
assertions get explained.

If the new example is a screenshot-worthy interactive demo, add it to
`scripts/demo_manifest.edn`'s `:examples` and regenerate with
`screen-grab shot --manifest scripts/demo_manifest.edn`. If it animates on its
own, without needing input, it can go in `scripts/demo_gifs.edn` instead and be
recorded with `screen-grab record`.

Both of those need the maintainer-only tooling above. A contribution that adds
an example is entirely welcome **without** an image — say so in the PR and it
can be captured on this side.
